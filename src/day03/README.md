## Notes

I feel dirty for abusing typecoersion JS quirks like `==` instead of `===` to abuse all the `1 == true` and `0 == false` foo.
And somehow I think I could get rid of `depth` and work a little more on error cases. Right now I am assuming there is exactly one solution left to be found.
Obviously my solution is far from efficiency.
I did like to make use of currying though.
